To build a weather application using the provided HTML and CSS, follow this step-by-step algorithm for your JavaScript implementation:

Step 1: Initialize the Application
Create an initial setup to capture the elements you'll need to interact with, like the search input, weather display elements, and the button.
Step 2: Fetch the Weather Data
Write a function that fetches weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) based on the user's input (city name). Use fetch() to get the data asynchronously.
Step 3: Handle User Input
Add an event listener to the search button to trigger the weather data fetch when the user clicks the button or presses Enter after typing in the input field.
Step 4: Update the UI with Weather Data
Once the data is fetched, extract the necessary information (temperature, city name, weather icon, humidity, wind speed) from the API response.
Update the corresponding HTML elements (.temp, .city, .weather-icon, .humidity, .wind) with the fetched data.
Step 5: Error Handling
Implement error handling to manage cases where the city is not found or the API request fails. Display an appropriate message to the user.
Step 6: Optimize and Clean Up
Make sure to handle edge cases like empty input and prevent unnecessary API requests.
Consider adding a loading state or animation while fetching the data.
